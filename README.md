# How to change IP geographic location in Real Devices on [LambdaTest](https://www.lambdatest.com/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repo&utm_campaign=LT-appium-nodejs-geolocation) using the Appium & NodeJS

While performing app automation testing with appium on LambdaTest Grid, you may face a scenario where you would like to simulate location of a specific country. You can easily do that by using the lambdatest capability "GeoLocation" and refer the 2-letter country code in the automation script. You can refer to sample test repo [here](https://github.com/LambdaTest/LT-appium-nodejs).

# Steps:

The following is an example on how to set geoLocation in the capabilities.

Below is the ```Android.js``` example shown:

```js
var wd = require("wd")
var assert  = require("assert");
var asserter = wd.asserters;
username = (process.env.LT_USERNAME == undefined) ? "username" //Enter the username here
        : process.env.LT_USERNAME
accesskey = (process.env.LT_ACCESS_KEY == undefined) ? "access_key" //Enter the access_key here
        : process.env.LT_ACCESS_KEY
desired_capabilities = {
    'deviceName':'Galaxy S20',
    'platformVersion':'11',
    'platformName':'android',
    'isRealMobile':true,
    'app':'lt://', //Enter the app_url here
    'visual':true,
    'video': true,
    
    //ADD GEOLOCATION BASED ON COUNTRY CODE
    'geoLocation':'fr' 
}
driver = wd.promiseRemote(`https://${username}:${accesskey}@mobile-hub.lambdatest.com/wd/hub`)
async function Androidtest(){
try {
driver.init(desired_capabilities)
.then(function(){
    return driver.waitForElementById('color',10000)
})
.then(function(colorButton){
    return colorButton.click();
})
.then(function(){
    return driver.waitForElementById('Text',10000)
})
.then(function(text){
    text.click()
    return driver.waitForElementById('toast',10000)
})
.then(function(toast){
    toast.click()
    return driver.waitForElementById('notification',10000)
})
.then(function(find){
    find.click()
    driver.quit()
})
}
catch (e) {
    driver.quit()
}
}
Androidtest(); 
```

## Executing The Tests


Execute the following command (Android or iOS) to run your test on LambdaTest platform:

```bash
node android.js
```

```bash
node ios.js
```

Your test results would be displayed on the test console (or command-line interface if you are using terminal/cmd) and on the [LambdaTest App Automation Dashboard](https://appautomation.lambdatest.com/build).
